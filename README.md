Side Scroll Space Shooter

Second Android app using the libgdx library from badlogicgames.  Focusing on code readability and class management to make a bigger, 
and more complete game.  

This game is a side scrolling space shooter.  You move the ship by swiping your finger and the ship will follow.  The player ship will fire automatically when the screen is held down.  The ship is destroyed if hit once, or hit twice if you have picked up the power up for that level.  Power up orbs also upgrade the ship to fire two lasers instead of one.  It has 5 main levels with 5 unique boss battles at the end.  After you have beaten the main game survival mode starts and an infinite number of randomly generated levels are made until your ship is destroyed.  It records the top 5 high scores on the high scores page.
